### **Unit I: Introducing C# and the .NET Framework (7 Hrs.)** 
Sure, here's an overview of each topic in Unit I:

1. **Object Orientation**:
   - Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C#.
   - Concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
   - How OOP enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Explanation of type safety in C# and its importance in preventing runtime errors.
   - How C# enforces type safety through features like strong typing, type inference, and compile-time checks.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Overview of memory management in the .NET Framework's Common Language Runtime (CLR).
   - Discussion on garbage collection, memory allocation, and deallocation.
   - Importance of understanding memory management for writing efficient and scalable code.

4. **Platform Support**:
   - Discussion on the platforms supported by C# and the .NET Framework, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
   - Introduction to cross-platform development using .NET Core and .NET 5+.

5. **C# and CLR**:
   - Explanation of the relationship between C# and the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
   - How C# code is compiled to intermediate language (IL) and executed by the CLR.
   - Advantages of CLR, such as automatic memory management and language interoperability.

6. **CLR and .NET Framework**:
   - Overview of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and its role within the .NET Framework.
   - Discussion on how CLR provides services such as garbage collection, exception handling, and security.

7. **Other Frameworks**:
   - Introduction to other frameworks within the .NET ecosystem, such as ASP.NET, Xamarin, and Entity Framework.
   - Explanation of their respective purposes and how they extend the functionality of the .NET platform.

8. **Framework Overview**:
   - Overview of the .NET Framework, including its history, evolution, and key components.
   - Discussion on the modular structure of the framework and its various libraries and APIs.

9. **.NET Standard 2.0**:
   - Introduction to .NET Standard as a specification that defines a set of APIs for .NET implementations to adhere to.
   - Explanation of how .NET Standard enables code sharing between different .NET platforms.

10. **Applied Technologies**:
    - Practical applications of C# and the .NET Framework in real-world scenarios.
    - Examples of technologies and tools commonly used in C# development, such as Visual Studio, NuGet, and Azure.
