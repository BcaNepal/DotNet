Dynamic binding in C# refers to the ability of the language to defer the resolution of method calls and member accesses until runtime, rather than compile time. This is achieved using the `dynamic` keyword introduced in C# 4.0.

When you use the `dynamic` keyword to declare a variable, you're essentially telling the compiler to postpone type checking until runtime. This means that method invocations, property accesses, and other member accesses are resolved dynamically at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

Here's a basic example:

```csharp
dynamic dynamicVariable = 10;
Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable.GetType());  // Output: System.Int32

dynamicVariable = "Hello";
Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable.GetType());  // Output: System.String

dynamicVariable = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 };
Console.WriteLine(dynamicVariable.Count);  // Output: 3 (resolved at runtime)
```

In this example, `dynamicVariable` can hold values of different types, and the type checking is deferred until runtime. When you call `GetType()` or access the `Count` property, the actual type of `dynamicVariable` is determined at runtime, and the appropriate method or property is invoked.

Dynamic binding can be useful in scenarios where you're working with COM objects, interacting with dynamic languages like JavaScript, or dealing with scenarios where you don't know the type of an object until runtime.

However, it's important to note that dynamic binding bypasses compile-time type checking, so you lose some of the benefits of static typing, such as compile-time type safety and IntelliSense support. Additionally, using dynamic binding extensively can lead to less maintainable code, as it can make the code harder to understand and reason about. Therefore, it's generally recommended to use dynamic binding judiciously and only when necessary.
