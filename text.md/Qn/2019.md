#### Differentiate Object Oriented Programming and Object Based Programming. Explain some of the major features of C# language. 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Object-Based Programming (OBP) are related but distinct concepts in programming paradigms.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. In OOP, objects can contain data (properties) and code (methods), and they interact with each other through well-defined interfaces. OOP provides a way to model real-world objects and their relationships within a software system.

Key features of OOP:
1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together in a single unit (class), hiding implementation details, and providing a public interface.
2. Inheritance: Allowing new classes to be based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and methods, and adding new functionality.
3. Abstraction: Representing essential features without including background details or implementation.
4. Polymorphism: Allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Object-Based Programming (OBP):
OBP is a programming approach that focuses on creating objects and using them to design applications and computer programs. However, OBP does not necessarily incorporate all the principles of OOP, such as inheritance and polymorphism. In OBP, objects are used to encapsulate data and code, but they are not organized into a class hierarchy, and inheritance is not a core concept.

Major features of C# language:
C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a multi-paradigm language that supports both OOP and functional programming concepts. Here are some of the major features of C#:

1. **Object-Oriented**: C# fully supports object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

2. **Type Safety**: C# is a type-safe language, which means that variables must be explicitly declared with a specific data type, and type conversions are checked at compile-time.

3. **Managed Code**: C# runs on the .NET Framework or .NET Core, which provides automatic memory management (garbage collection) and other managed execution services.

4. **Exception Handling**: C# has a structured and robust exception handling mechanism, making it easier to handle and recover from runtime errors.

5. **Generics**: C# supports generic programming, which allows for the creation of reusable code that can work with different data types.

6. **Delegates and Events**: C# provides built-in support for delegates (function pointers) and events, which facilitate event-driven programming and callbacks.

7. **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: LINQ provides a set of query operators that can be used to query and manipulate data from various sources, such as collections, databases, and XML documents.

8. **Asynchronous Programming**: C# has built-in support for asynchronous programming using async and await keywords, making it easier to write responsive and efficient code.

9. **Interoperability**: C# can interact with other .NET languages and can also interoperate with native code written in languages like C or C++ through the Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke).

10. **Unified Type System**: C# has a unified type system that treats all types, including primitive types, as objects, simplifying programming and providing consistency.

These are just some of the major features of C#. The language also offers powerful libraries, tools, and frameworks for building a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and cloud-based applications.

#### Explain overview of Microsoft .NET framework and its components in detail.
-> The Microsoft .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that provides a runtime environment and a set of libraries and tools for building and running applications on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. It consists of several components that work together to enable developers to create robust, scalable, and secure applications.

Here's an overview of the .NET Framework and its major components:

1. **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**: The CLR is the heart of the .NET Framework. It is a virtual machine that manages the execution of .NET programs. The CLR provides several essential services, such as memory management (garbage collection), code management (just-in-time compilation and caching), exception handling, security, and thread management.

2. **Base Class Libraries (BCL)**: The BCL is a comprehensive collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and value types that provide a wide range of functionality for various programming tasks. It includes classes for data management, file and network operations, security, user interface development, and more. The BCL is organized into namespaces, such as `System`, `System.Collections`, `System.IO`, and `System.Xml`.

3. **Common Language Specification (CLS)**: The CLS is a set of rules and guidelines that define how programming languages should be constructed to ensure interoperability within the .NET Framework. It specifies the rules for naming, data types, and other language constructs to ensure that code written in different .NET languages can work together seamlessly.

4. **Common Type System (CTS)**: The CTS defines how types (classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations, and delegates) are declared, used, and managed in the .NET Framework. It ensures that all .NET programming languages share a common understanding of types, enabling code written in different languages to interact and interoperate effectively.

5. **Common Intermediate Language (CIL)**: CIL, also known as Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), is a CPU-independent instruction set that is generated by .NET compilers from source code. The CLR executes CIL instructions during runtime, providing language independence and cross-platform execution capabilities.

6. **Assemblies**: Assemblies are the fundamental units of deployment, distribution, and versioning in the .NET Framework. An assembly is a collection of one or more files (modules) that are versioned and self-describing. Assemblies can contain executable code (EXE files), libraries (DLL files), or both.

7. **Metadata**: Metadata is structured data that describes the contents and characteristics of an assembly, including its types, members, dependencies, and other information. The CLR uses metadata to locate and load classes, lay out instances in memory, resolve references, and perform other essential tasks.

8. **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**: The JIT compiler is a component of the CLR that compiles CIL code into native machine code at runtime, just before it is executed. This process improves performance by optimizing the code for the specific hardware and operating system it is running on.

9. **Garbage Collector**: The .NET Framework includes an automatic memory management system called the Garbage Collector. It is responsible for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use, freeing developers from manual memory management tasks and reducing the risk of memory leaks.

10. **Framework Class Library (FCL)**: The FCL is a superset of the BCL and includes additional libraries and classes for building various types of applications, such as Windows Forms, ASP.NET, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).

11. **Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)**: The CLI is an open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ECMA and ISO. It defines the executable code and runtime environment conventions that form the core of the .NET Framework and other implementations, such as Mono and .NET Core.

These components work together to provide a comprehensive and integrated development environment for building and running .NET applications on multiple platforms. The .NET Framework has evolved over time, with new versions introducing additional features, improvements, and support for new technologies.
#### What do you mean by property in C# language? How it is different from method? Compare automatic property with other types of property with suitable example.
-> In C#, a property is a member of a class that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields. It acts as an intermediary between the private fields and the outside world, allowing controlled access to the class's data members.

Properties are different from methods in the following ways:

1. **Syntax**: Properties use a different syntax than methods. They are defined with a get and/or set accessor blocks, while methods are defined with a method signature and a body.

2. **Access**: Properties are accessed using an instance of the class and the property name, without parentheses. Methods are called using an instance and method name with parentheses and optional parameters.

3. **Purpose**: Properties are typically used to encapsulate the access to a class's private fields, providing a way to read or modify the data. Methods, on the other hand, are used to perform operations or actions within the class.

Here's an example that demonstrates the different types of properties in C#:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    // 1. Simple property with private backing field
    private string _name;
    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set { _name = value; }
    }

    // 2. Automatic property
    public int Age { get; set; }

    // 3. Read-only property
    public string FullName
    {
        get { return $"{FirstName} {LastName}"; }
    }

    // 4. Property with computed value
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;

    public string FirstName
    {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set { _firstName = value; }
    }

    public string LastName
    {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set { _lastName = value; }
    }
}
```

1. **Simple property with private backing field**: `Name` is a simple property that uses a private field `_name` to store the value. The `get` accessor retrieves the value, and the `set` accessor sets the value.

2. **Automatic property**: `Age` is an automatic property, which is a shorthand syntax introduced in C# 3.0. The compiler automatically creates a private backing field and generates the `get` and `set` accessors for you.

3. **Read-only property**: `FullName` is a read-only property that combines the `FirstName` and `LastName` properties into a single string. It does not have a `set` accessor, so the value cannot be modified directly from outside the class.

4. **Property with computed value**: `FirstName` and `LastName` are properties that use separate private fields to store the values. The `FullName` property combines these values to compute the full name.

Automatic properties are a concise way to define properties without explicitly declaring a private backing field. They are particularly useful when you don't need any additional logic in the property accessors. Here's an example of using the `Person` class with automatic properties:

```csharp
Person person = new Person();
person.FirstName = "John";
person.LastName = "Doe";
person.Age = 30;

Console.WriteLine(person.FullName); // Output: John Doe
Console.WriteLine(person.Age); // Output: 30
```

In this example, we can directly set the values of `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Age` using the automatic properties, and access the read-only `FullName` property.

Automatic properties provide a more concise syntax when you don't need additional logic in the property accessors. However, simple properties with private backing fields and properties with computed values are still useful when you need to add custom logic or validation in the property accessors.

#### Define constructor. Explain different types of constructors used in C# with example.
-> In C#, a constructor is a special member method of a class that is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. Its purpose is to initialize the newly created object and prepare it for use.

C# supports several types of constructors, each serving a different purpose. Here are the different types of constructors used in C#:

1. Default Constructor:
A default constructor is a constructor that doesn't take any parameters. It is automatically created by the compiler if no constructors are defined explicitly. Its purpose is to initialize the object's instance variables with default values. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    // Default constructor
    public MyClass()
    {
        // Initialization code
    }
}
```

2. Parameterized Constructor:
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more parameters. It allows you to initialize an object with specific values at the time of creation. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    // Parameterized constructor
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }
}
```

3. Copy Constructor:
A copy constructor is used to create a new object by copying the values of another object. It is useful when you want to create a separate copy of an existing object. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public Person(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }
    public Person(Person other)
    {
        Name = other.Name;
        Age = other.Age;
    }
}```

4. Static Constructor:
A static constructor is used to initialize static members of a class. It is called only once, before any static members are accessed or any objects of the class are created. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class Logger
{
    public static int LogCount { get; private set; }
    // Static constructor
    static Logger()
    {
        LogCount = 0;
    }
}
```

Note: C# also supports other advanced constructor concepts like private constructor, constructor chaining, and so on. However, the ones mentioned above are the most common types used.
These are the different types of constructors used in C#. They provide flexibility in object initialization and allow you to customize the construction process based on your requirements.
#### Define inheritance. Write a C# program to demonstrate multilevel and multiple inheritance.
-> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. The new class, called the derived class or subclass, inherits the members (fields, properties, and methods) from the existing class, called the base class or superclass. This allows for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

In C#, inheritance is supported through single inheritance, where a class can inherit from only one base class. However, C# does not support multiple inheritance (inheriting from multiple base classes directly). Instead, it provides an alternative mechanism called interface implementation to achieve similar functionality.

Here's an example program in C# that demonstrates multilevel inheritance:

```csharp
// Base class
class Vehicle
{
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    public void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started.");
    }
}

// Derived class
class Car : Vehicle
{
    public int NumDoors { get; set; }

    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Driving the car.");
    }
}

// Derived class from Car
class ElectricCar : Car
{
    public double BatteryCapacity { get; set; }

    public void ChargeBattery()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Charging the battery.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ElectricCar tesla = new ElectricCar();
        tesla.Brand = "Tesla";
        tesla.Year = 2022;
        tesla.NumDoors = 4;
        tesla.BatteryCapacity = 100.0;

        tesla.StartEngine(); // Inherited from Vehicle
        tesla.Drive(); // Inherited from Car
        tesla.ChargeBattery(); // Defined in ElectricCar

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Vehicle` class is the base class, and the `Car` class inherits from it. The `ElectricCar` class is derived from the `Car` class, inheriting members from both `Vehicle` and `Car`. This demonstrates multilevel inheritance, where a derived class inherits from another derived class.

While C# does not support multiple inheritance directly, it provides an alternative through interface implementation. Interfaces define a contract that classes must implement, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance of behavior.

Here's an example program that demonstrates interface implementation:

```csharp
interface IVehicle
{
    void StartEngine();
}
interface IElectric
{
    void ChargeBattery();
}
class ElectricCar : IVehicle, IElectric
{
    public void StartEngine()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Engine started.");
    }
    public void ChargeBattery()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Charging the battery.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        ElectricCar tesla = new ElectricCar();
        tesla.StartEngine();
        tesla.ChargeBattery();

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ElectricCar` class implements both the `IVehicle` and `IElectric` interfaces, effectively inheriting the behavior defined in those interfaces. This allows the `ElectricCar` class to exhibit multiple inheritance of behavior through interface implementation.
#### What is generics? List different types of generic classes. Explain delegate with example.
-> **Generics**

Generics in C# allow you to define reusable classes, methods, and data structures that can work with different data types without needing to create separate implementations for each type. Generics provide type safety and performance benefits by eliminating the need for explicit type casting and boxing/unboxing operations.

**Different Types of Generic Classes**:

1. **Generic Class**: A class that has one or more type parameters.
   Example:
   ```csharp
   public class GenericList<T>
   {
       private T[] items;
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Generic Interface**: An interface that has one or more type parameters.
   Example:
   ```csharp
   public interface IRepository<T>
   {
       void Add(T item);
       T GetById(int id);
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Generic Method**: A method that has one or more type parameters.
   Example:
   ```csharp
   public class Utilities
   {
       public static void Swap<T>(ref T a, ref T b)
       {
           T temp = a;
           a = b;
           b = temp;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Generic Delegate**: A delegate that has one or more type parameters.
   Example:
   ```csharp
   public delegate T Operation<T>(T a, T b);
   ```

5. **Generic Struct**: A struct that has one or more type parameters.
   Example:
   ```csharp
   public struct Nullable<T> where T : struct
   {
       private bool hasValue;
       private T value;
       // ...
   }
   ```

6. **Constraints on Generic Types**: You can apply constraints to the type parameters of generic classes, interfaces, and methods to restrict the types that can be used. Common constraints include reference types (`where T : class`), value types (`where T : struct`), constructors (`where T : new()`), and inheritance (`where T : BaseClass`).

**Delegates**

A delegate in C# is a type that represents a method with a particular signature. It allows you to pass methods as arguments to other methods, or to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed around. Delegates provide a way to implement callback methods and event handlers in C#.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of delegates:

```csharp
// Define a delegate type
public delegate void OperationDelegate(int a, int b);

// Define a class with methods that match the delegate signature
public class Calculator
{
    public static void Add(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{a} + {b} = {a + b}");
    }
    public static void Subtract(int a, int b)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{a} - {b} = {a - b}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an instance of the delegate and assign a method to it
        OperationDelegate operation = Calculator.Add;
        // Call the method through the delegate instance
        operation(10, 5); // Output: 10 + 5 = 15
        // Assign a different method to the delegate instance
        operation = Calculator.Subtract;
        operation(10, 5); // Output: 10 - 5 = 5
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We define a delegate type `OperationDelegate` that represents a method that takes two integers as input and returns void.
2. We create a `Calculator` class with two static methods, `Add` and `Subtract`, that match the signature of the `OperationDelegate`.
3. In the `Main` method, we create an instance of the `OperationDelegate` and assign the `Calculator.Add` method to it.
4. We call the method through the delegate instance using `operation(10, 5)`, which invokes the `Calculator.Add` method.
5. We then reassign the `Calculator.Subtract` method to the delegate instance.
6. When we call `operation(10, 5)` again, it now invokes the `Calculator.Subtract` method.

Delegates allow you to write more flexible and extensible code by separating the method implementation from the code that uses it. They are commonly used for event handling, asynchronous programming, and implementing callback mechanisms.
