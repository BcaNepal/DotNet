Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. Here are the key features of OOP:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. This helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing the necessary functionalities to interact with it, thus promoting data security and preventing unintended access.

2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and only showing the essential features of the object. This allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality, thus simplifying the programming interface and enhancing code readability and maintainability.

3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (derived class or subclass) is created from an existing class (base class or superclass), inheriting its attributes and methods. This facilitates code reusability, as the derived class can reuse the code from its superclass and extend or modify its behavior as needed. Inheritance also supports the concept of "is-a" relationships, where a subclass is a specialized version of its superclass.

4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility in code design. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism), allowing methods to behave differently based on the object they are invoked upon or the arguments they receive.

5. **Modularity**: Modularity refers to the principle of breaking down a program into smaller, manageable, and reusable components, or modules. In OOP, classes serve as modules that encapsulate related data and behavior, promoting code organization and facilitating code maintenance and scalability.

These features collectively contribute to the strengths of OOP, including code reusability, maintainability, scalability, and extensibility, making it a widely used and preferred paradigm for software development.
